OVERVIEW

    You are viewing help for models defined in the current directory.

    To run a model operation use 'guild run MODEL:OPERATION' where MODEL
    is one of the model names listed below and OPERATION is an associated
    operation.

    You may set operation flags using 'FLAG=VALUE' arguments to the run
    command. Refer to the operations below for a list of supported flags.
    Model flags apply to all operations.

    For more help, try 'guild run --help' or 'guild --help'.
